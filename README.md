# Social-Network-API

## Description
This project is the back-end for a social media website. The project includes models and routes for users, thoughts, and reactions. With this back-end, a front-end could be built to have a full stack social media website. The project includes CRUD routes so you can create, read, update, and delete users, thoughts and reactions. You can also add users as "friends" to other users.
